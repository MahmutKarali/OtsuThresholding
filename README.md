-----------------------------------------------------------
Thresholding is a very basic operation in image processing. And, a good algorithm always begins with a good basis! Otsu thresholding is a simple yet effective global automatic thresholding method for binarizing grayscale images such as foregrounds and backgrounds.

#Advantages

• Speed: Because Otsu threshold operates on histograms (which are integer or float arrays of length 256), it’s quite fast.


• Ease of coding: Approximately 80 lines of very easy stuff.
